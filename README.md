#Phishing Detection and Response System
Welcome to the Phishing Detection and Response System! This application analyzes incoming emails in real-time to detect potential phishing attacks using machine learning models. It flags suspicious emails and provides a summary of findings for secure email handling. The backend is built with a modularized structure, prioritizing scalability, maintainability, and best practices.

About the Project
This project provides a phishing detection backend system that integrates AI and ML models to identify and flag phishing emails based on various features. This setup allows email analysis in real-time and batch processing modes, enabling continuous protection and analysis for both live and historical emails.

#Key motivations include:

Raising Awareness: Highlight the common tactics used in phishing emails.
Email Security: Provide users with a tool to ensure email security with automated alerts for phishing threats.
Project Structure
The project follows a modular structure, designed for readability, scalability, and adherence to best practices.

#Features
Real-Time Email Analysis: Analyze incoming emails instantly and flag phishing emails.
Historical Email Processing: Processes emails received during downtime when the application restarts.
Modular Design: Structured for efficient maintenance and readability.
Database Integration: Stores email metadata and analysis results in MongoDB.
User Authentication: Allows users to log in using various email providers (Gmail, Outlook, Privatemail, etc.).
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
MongoDB: To store email metadata and analysis results.
A Mail Server: For email fetching and analysis.
Recommended packages listed in requirements.txt.

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/wisdom-thompson/phishing-detection
cd phishing-detection
Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and set the following variables:

env
Copy code
MAIL_SERVER=your_mail_server
MAIL_USERNAME=your_email
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri

API Endpoints
Endpoint Method Description
/fetch GET Fetch and analyze emails from server
/analyze POST Analyze a specific email
/results GET Retrieve analysis results
Model Training
To train the model on a custom dataset, follow these steps:

Prepare Dataset: Ensure your dataset includes email content and labels (phishing or not phishing).
Train the Model: Use the model/train_model.py script.
Save the Model: Trained models and vectorizers will be saved in the model/ directory.
Example training command:

python model/train_model.py --dataset path/to/your/dataset.csv
The model and vectorizer will be saved as model/phishing_model.joblib and model/vectorizer.joblib.
